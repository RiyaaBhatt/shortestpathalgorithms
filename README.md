# Shortest Path Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of two popular shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. These algorithms are used to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy networkx matplotlib


<p>Choose an algorithm from the menu:</p>
<p>Enter 1 for Dijkstra's Algorithm.<br>
Enter 2 for Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.<br>
Enter 3 to exit the program.</p>

<p><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. You can input a graph and a source node to find the shortest paths using this algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. It computes the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in the graph.</p>

<p><strong>Graph Visualization</strong></p>
<p>The code also includes a graph visualization function using NetworkX and Matplotlib. It can visualize the input graph and highlight the shortest path if provided.</p>

<p>Feel free to customize the README further to include more details or instructions specific to your project or use case.</p>
