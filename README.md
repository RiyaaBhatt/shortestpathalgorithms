Shortest Path Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of two popular shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. These algorithms are used to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
NetworkX
Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:

  pip install numpy networkx matplotlib

Usage<br>
1.Clone the repository to your local machine<br>
2.Navigate to the cloned directory<br>
3.Run the main Python script<br>


Choose an algorithm from the menu:<br>
Enter 1 for Dijkstra's Algorithm.<br>
Enter 2 for Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.<br>
Enter 3 to exit the program.<be>
<br>
Dijkstra's Algorithm<br>
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. You can input a graph and a source node to find the shortest paths using this algorithm.
<br>
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm<br>
The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. It computes the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in the graph.
<br>
Graph Visualization<br>
The code also includes a graph visualization function using NetworkX and Matplotlib. It can visualize the input graph and highlight the shortest path if provided.
